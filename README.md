# 🚀 Introduction

- This project provides a lightweight web interface to download YouTube videos directly to your Android device via Termux. Built with Flask and yt-dlp, it lets you:

- Streamline video downloads with a simple web UI 📥

- Choose video quality up to your preference 🎞️

- Optionally download subtitles 📄

- Monitor real-time progress above the progress bar, and yes the progress bar doesn't work. The visual progress bar currently does not update due to an ongoing issue with tracking yt-dlp download events in Flask. If you can solve make a PR! ⏱️


## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. Flask Server: Hosts the web interface and handles routes:

/ – Main form to input URL, quality, subtitles option.

/progress – Returns JSON with download progress.

/download – Serves the completed video file.

### 2. Downloader Thread:

Uses yt-dlp to fetch videos in a background thread.

Custom download_hook updates shared progress dict.

### 3. Safe Filenames:

Filenames normalized to ASCII and stripped of unsafe characters.

### 4. Termux Integration:

On launch, auto-opens the UI in Android’s default browser via termux-open-url.

# 🚀 Running on Your Device

**Follow these steps to get started:**

1. Install Termux on your Android device from the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases).


2. Update packages:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

3. Allow the termux storage access:

```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

4. Install Python & Git:

```bash
pkg install python git
```

5. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ysathyasai/Flask-Video-Downloader.git
cd Flask-Video-Downloader
```

5(1). Create virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

6. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Run the app:

```bash

> Program will open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ automatically 📱
