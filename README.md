### üß† Verdict

- ‚úÖ It works great for Termux / Android use-case.

# üöÄ Introduction

This project provides a lightweight web interface to download YouTube videos directly to your Android device via **Termux**. <details>
  <summary>(Also works on PC or laptop with minor changes)</summary>
  The main change required is replacing the `termux-open-url` command with a cross-platform method to open the browser. On desktop systems, `termux-open-url` will cause an error. You can replace it with the following Python code:

  ```python
  import webbrowser
  webbrowser.open("http://127.0.0.1:5000/")
  ```

  This ensures compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

</details>

- Built with Flask and yt-dlp, it lets you:

  - Streamline video downloads with a simple web UI üì•

  - Choose video quality up to your preference üéûÔ∏è

  - Optionally download subtitles üìÑ

  - Monitor real-time progress above the progress bar, and yes the progress bar doesn't work. The visual progress bar currently does not update due to an ongoing issue with tracking yt-dlp download events in Flask. If you can solve make a PR! ‚è±Ô∏è


## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### 1. Flask Server: Hosts the web interface and handles routes:

/ ‚Äì Main form to input URL, quality, subtitles option.

/progress ‚Äì Returns JSON with download progress.

/download ‚Äì Serves the completed video file.

### 2. Downloader Thread:

Uses yt-dlp to fetch videos in a background thread.

Custom download_hook updates shared progress dict.

### 3. Safe Filenames:

Filenames normalized to ASCII and stripped of unsafe characters.

### 4. Termux Integration:

On launch, auto-opens the UI in Android‚Äôs default browser via termux-open-url.

2. Update packages:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

3. Allow the termux storage access:

```bash

| Storage permission not granted             | Run: `termux-setup-storage`                                             |
|                                            | Allows access to `~/storage/shared/downloads`                             |
| No internet connection                     | Ensure you're connected to the internet                                 |
| Invalid or unsupported YouTube URL         | Check the URL validity                                                  |
|                                            | Add: `if not info: handle error`                                        |
| Filename becomes empty (emoji-only titles) | In `safe_filename()`:                                                   |
|                                            | `if not safe_title: safe_title = "video"`                                |
| Subtitles not available                    | Already handled with `'ignoreerrors': True`                             |
| File deleted before download is accessed   | Already handled with `os.path.exists()`                                 |
| Concurrent downloads overwrite each other  | Use session-based IDs if multi-user or parallel downloads are supported |

If possible use the try/except block's and prompt the user about the issue.
